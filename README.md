This repository contains binary (Intel / Linux) builds for the 
[Revelation simulator](https://github.com/futurecore/revelation).
Revelation is a [just-in-time (JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
simulator for the [Epiphany architecture](http://adapteva.com/docs/epiphany_arch_ref.pdf).
It is written in [RPython](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and based on the 
[Pydgin simulator framework](https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin).

See the [Revelation repository](https://github.com/futurecore/revelation) for more details.
